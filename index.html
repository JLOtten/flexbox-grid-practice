                <p> I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who thrives on sleek and easy-to-use user interfaces and experiences. 
                    When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole of 
                    blogs & books, I can be found hiking, walking my dogs or playing soccer with my sons.</p>

                I was born in Cleveland and raised in Columbus, Ohio and now live in 
                the beautiful San Francisco Bay area. I have lived in upstate NY, New Orleans, 
                Minneapolis and Barcelona--and have decided that a Mediterranean climate that is 
                near snowy mountians is for me.

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                My greatest passion is being a mom. I am a teacher by training, but found that 
                I will be able to care for my family and myself with a more flexible role in tech.
                I'm excited for this transition because I like continuously learning new things
                and see so many possibilities to make a positive contribution or impact with coding 
                and UX design skills.

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                I write my first line of code until I was 37 years old. But, I think my background in 
                teaching, language learning and parenting will give me a unique and valuble experience
                in the tech space. As I understand many real-world problems more deeply as an adult,
                I can help design products and create user expereinces that help solve these problems
                for so many other people who are like me.
